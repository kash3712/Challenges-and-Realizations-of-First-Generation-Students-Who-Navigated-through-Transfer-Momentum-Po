The current study explores contextual factors that contribute to the linkage between perceived barriers and career outcome expectations of first-generation college students (FGCS). The authors tested how FGCS’ sense of coherence, social support from family, peers, and a special person, as well as their sense of campus connectedness mediate or moderate the effect of perceived educational and career barriers on their vocational outcome expectations. Participants were 153 ethnically diverse FGCS attending public universities. Moderation analysis indicated that campus connectedness was a significant moderator—for FGCS who experience low or average level of campus connectedness, higher levels of barriers are associated with more negative career outcome expectations. Mediation analysis supported that the relationship between perceived barriers and career outcome expectations was mediated by sense of coherence. None of the other social support variables were statistically significant as a moderator. Implications for future research and program development are discussed.

A growing body of research in the past two decades has explored the educational and career develop ment experience of first-generation college students (FGCS)—defined as college students whose parents did not attend college or attain a bachelor’s degree (Jehangir, 2010). FGCS are overrepresented by students from marginalized ethnic/racial groups or from low-income backgrounds (Engle & Tinto, 2008; Tate et al., 2015a). They typically have lower levels of social integration on campus (Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998), completed fewer credit hours (Majer, 2009), and attained their credentials at

lower rates than their non-FGCS counterparts (Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998). This difference remains even when controlling for ethnicity, family income, and academic preparation (Gibbons & Borders, 2010; Horn & Nunez, 2000). 
FGCS also face greater challenges and barriers standing in their way of achieving their career goals compared with non-FGCS (Gibbons & Shoffner, 2004). In a study conducted with prospective FGCS (PFGCS; seventh graders whose parents did not attend college and who have not yet graduated from high school themselves), Gibbons and Borders (2010) found that PFGCS identified issues such as fam ily, finances, racial/ethnic discrimination, lack of college-educated role models, and lack of prepara tion and/or desire as perceived barriers to higher education, whereas non-PFGCS reported barriers only related to financial and school stress. Prior research (Bandura, 1986; McWhirter, 1997; Urbanaviciute, Pociute, Kairys, & Liniauskaite, 2016) has established that perceptions of barriers can contribute to negative outcome expectations (how they feel about the consequences of performing a specific beha vior). In the case of FGCS, Davis (2010) observed that FGCS, compared with non-FGCS, can be more present oriented and less likely to think about the benefits of a college education and its connection to future employability. They also tend to believe that college may lead to fewer positive results for them compared with other students (Gibbons & Borders, 2010). Furthermore, when the barrier to success seems too difficult to overcome, FGCS may eliminate certain choices or goals regarding their educa tion and future career. 
Taking this into consideration, the intent of the present study is to gain knowledge of factors that can further explain the links between FGCS’ perceived barriers and career outcome expectations and to identify protective factors against their perceived barriers. Recently, researchers have highlighted social cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994, 2000) as a useful theoretical model to understand the career development experience of FGCS (e.g., Gibbons & Borders, 2010; Raque-Bogdan & Lucas, 2016; Tate et al., 2015b). SCCT emphasizes one’s learning history as well as personal, environmental, and social cognitive factors that contribute to a student’s career interest and goals. This theory is applicable to FGCS because it takes into account the contextual influences (e.g., support and barriers) on one’s career pursuit (Gibbons & Borders, 2010; Lent et al., 1994, 2000). In addition, cognitive factors such as career self-efficacy—the belief in one’s ability in pursuing career-related tasks—is another important factor that interacts with career outcome expectations and career interests (Lent et al.,1994; O’Brien, Friedman, Tipton, & Linn, 2000). Using SCCT as our guid ing framework, the contextual variables we attempt to assess in this study are social support and sense of connectedness on campus. We also proposed that SCCT can be augmented by the salutogenic theory (Antonovsky, 1987) and selected the construct sense of coherence as a cognitive factor that is espe cially appropriate for the FGCS population in our investigation. In the following sections, we highlight the literature and conceptual evidence on how social support and campus connectedness might mod erate the impact of perceived barriers on FGCS’ career outcome expectations and how a sense of coherence might mediate the relationship between perceived barriers and career outcome expectations for FGCS. 
Social Support and Campus Connectedness as Potential Moderators 
Studies have established a correlation between the level of social support and FGCS’ ability to achieve success within the academic environment (Phinney & Haas, 2003). In recent decades, research in this area has examined relationship-specific domains of support, for example, the differential impact of family and peer support on college students’ psychological well-being and academic outcome (Dennis, Phinney, & Chuateco, 2005). It was found that FGCS reported significantly less support from family, especially emotional, informational, and financial support from their parents, compared with their non FGCS counterparts (Jenkins, Belanger, Connally, Boals, & Duro´n, 2013). In their qualitative study, Tate and colleagues (2015a) noted that some FGCS reported having families that showed a great deal 
Ma and Shea 93
of support for their academic pursuit, but at the same time, some expressed that their parents lack the knowledge to help them navigate college and career development processes. In a similar vein, peers who do not have or value a college education may not be supportive of FGCS’ academic endeavors. It has been noted that FGCS perceived less encouragement from friends and peer support toward college enrollment compared with non-FGCS (Jenkins et al., 2013). Beyond family and peers, there are other people that may serve as sources of support for FGCS, such as men tors, advisors, and significant others (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). The nature of these spe cial relationships can have a positive impact on FGCS’ outlook on their future career, especially for those students with family and friends who may not be able to relate to the challenges associated with attending college. 
Another important dimension related to social support is college students’ sense of belonging and connectedness to one’s campus community (Stebleton, Soria, & Huesman, 2014; Williams & Ferrari, 2015). Greater academic and social integration on campus is strongly linked to college students’ per sistence, retention, and graduation (Hausmann, Schofield, & Woods, 2007). Previous literature has established that FGCS tend to have a lower sense of belonging and connectedness on campus than non-FGCS. The reasons could be linked to their school, work, and family obligations, which result in limited time for social engagement and campus activities (Stebleton et al., 2014; William & Ferrari, 2015). In addition, limited academic and social connectedness may account for the alarmingly high dropout rate among FGCS (Jehangir, 2010), whereas a stronger sense of integration on campus is linked to a lower rate of stress and depression for FGCS. 
Taken together, the presence of social support and a sense of connectedness on campus can serve as a buffer against various forms of stressors for college students (Drum, Brownson, Hess, Denmark, & Talley, 2017; Wang, Cai, Qian, & Peng, 2014). The lack thereof can further contribute to negative out come expectations. Our study intended to further investigate the moderating effect of these contextual variables. 
Sense of Coherence as a Potential Mediator 
The salutogenic theory (Antonovsky, 1987) focuses on factors within an individual’s value systems and worldview that can positively enhance the individual’s health and well-being (Eriksson & Lind stro¨m, 2005; Kase, Endo, & Oishi, 2016). Within the salutogenic theory, the constructed sense of coherence is especially relevant for examining and understanding how FGCS cope with barriers and challenges. The sense of coherence refers to a person’s perception and sense of the world in which one is living as predictable, consistent, and reasonable. It includes three theoretically interwoven compo nents: comprehensibility (i.e., people’s ability to understand what happened around them), manage ability (i.e., things can be managed and there are choices of strategies), and meaningfulness (i.e., life demands have meanings; Antonovsky, 1987; Darling, McWey, Howard, & Olmstead, 2007; Eriksson & Lindstro¨m, 2005). Darling, McWey, Howard, and Olmstead (2007) explained that while self-efficacy is an important contributor to one’s ability to manage stressors (Antonovsky, 1998), the construct sense of coherence also incorporates the idea that one has a clear understanding of how to approach an issue and the willingness to utilize coping resources in a cogent and meaningful manner. 
Past research demonstrated that a higher sense of coherence facilitates adaptation and an increased ability to choose effectively the resources that are adequate and appropriate for coping with demanding situations (Davidson, Feldman, & Margalit, 2012). College students with a high sense of coherence employ problem-solving strategies rather than avoidant-coping strategies (Amirkhan & Greaves, 2003). When applying a sense of coherence to understand the career decision-making process, it was found that individuals demonstrating a higher sense of coherence display a lower level of negative career thinking (Austin, Dahl, & Wagner, 2010).

Past studies have found that sense of coherence mediates the effects of social support on the mental health outcomes in college students (Kase et al., 2016; Ying, Lee, & Tsai, 2007). Our study intended to explore how a sense of coherence might account for the relationship between FGCS’ perceived barriers and their career outcome expectations. Specifically, a sense of coherence—how they understand and interpret circumstances in their lives, how they utilize resources to tackle challenges, and how they establish meaning and purpose during adversities—is instrumental in how FGCS persist in the face of barriers and how they view their future career. 
Research Questions and Hypotheses 
The present study intended to explore the factors that contribute to the links between FGCS’ perceived barriers and career outcome expectations. Specifically, we investigated: 
(a) How would do FGCS’ multidimensional social support (from family, friends, and a special person), campus connectedness, and sense of coherence influence their career outcome expec tations? We hypothesized that a sense of coherence, social support from family, friends, or a special person and campus connectedness are significantly and positively associated with career outcome expectations. 
(b) How might campus connectedness and support from family, friends, and special persons mod erate the effect of perceived barriers on to their vocational outcome expectations? We hypothesized that these variables are significant moderators that might mitigate the negative perceived barrier effects on career outcome expectations. 
(c) How might FGCS’ sense of coherence account for the association between their perceived bar riers and career outcome expectations? We hypothesized that a sense of coherence would be a significant mediator in the relationship between perception of barriers and career outcome expectations. 
Method 
Participants and Procedures 
Participants were recruited from the undergraduate psychology subject pool and psychology classes in two public universities—one on the west coast and one on the east coast—with a predominantly commuter student population. The inclusion criteria were a minimum of 18 years and identification as first generation college-going students (i.e., neither parent has attended nor graduated from college). Partici pants received course or extra credit for their participation. The sample consisted of 153 students (85% females; average age ¼ 21.61 years, SD ¼ 2.93). Most participants were U.S. born (75.9% second generation and 1.2% third generation), 22.9% were immigrant, and 2% were international students. In terms of ethnic background, the majority of the participants self-identified as Latinx (56.9%), the rest were American Indian or Native American (0.6%), African American or Black (8.5%), Asian American or Pacific Islanders (5.9%), White or European American (26.1%), and biracial/multiracial or others (2.0%). 
Measures 
Scores for all measures were determined by averaging scores across all items. Higher scores indicate stronger magnitude of the construct. 
Perceptions of barriers. The Perceptions of Barriers Scale–Revised (Luzzo & McWhirter, 2001) is a 32- item scale that measures college students’ perceptions of current and future education and career

related barriers (e.g., In my future career, I will probably be treated differently because of my racial/ ethnic background) rated from 1 ¼ strongly disagree to 5 ¼ strongly agree. Research has found that self-efficacy was negatively associated with the perception of career-related barriers among Latinx college students (Mejia-Smith & Gushue, 2017). Previous studies using this scale with racially diverse college student samples reported adequate internal consistency range from .90 to .91 (Luzzo & McWhirter, 2001; Tate et al., 2015b). In the present study, the a coefficient was .91. 
Campus connectedness. The Social Connectedness Scale-Campus Version (Lee, Draper, & Lee, 2001) is a 14-item scale that measures college students’ sense of belonging and closeness with others in college campus context (e.g., I can relate to my fellow classmates) rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). This scale has been used among ethnically diverse college student samples (Lee, 2003; Lee, Keough, & Sexton, 2002). Lee (2003) reported concurrent evidence of validity with depres sive symptoms, self-esteem, and community well-being, as well as an internal reliability estimate of .93. In the present study, the a coefficient was .92. 
Social support. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet et al., 1988) comprises three 4-item subscales that measure perceived support from three sources: family (MSPSS-FA), friends (MSPSS-FR), and a special or significant other (MSPSS-SO). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sample items are “There is a special person who is around when I am in need” and “I can talk about my problems with my family.” Previous studies demonstrated adequate construct validity and reliability for the MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988). Specifically, factor analysis confirmed the subscale structure of MSPSS, suggesting that these sources of support—family, friends, and a special person—are distinct and independent of one another (Dahlem, Zimet, & Walker, 1991). Previous studies reported satisfactory a coefficients for the MSPSS subscales among ethnically diverse stu dent samples (Edwards & Lopez, 2006; Reid, Holt, Bowman, Espelage, & Green, 2016). In the present study, the a coefficients were .93 for MSPSS-FA, .91 for MSPSS-FR, and .89 for MSPSS-SO. 
Sense of coherence. The Sense of Coherence Scale (SOCS; Antonovsky, 1987) is a 29-item scale that measures the comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness of participants’ lives (e.g., How often do you have the feeling that there’s little meaning in the things you do in your daily life?) rated from 1 (very often) to 7 (very seldom or never). Previous research has demonstrated adequate construct validity and reliability for this scale with Cronback’s a value ranging from .70 to .95 in 124 studies (Eriksson & Lindstro¨m, 2005). Antonovsky (1987) suggested that a sense of coherence is an internal resource that strengthens physical and mental health. Empirical research has found SOCS to be asso ciated with psychological adjustment (Ying & Akutsu, 1997) and depressive symptoms (Ying et al., 2007). In the current study, the a coefficient was .89. 
Career outcome expectations. The Vocational Outcome Expectation Scale (McWhirter, Crothers, & Rasheed, 2000) is a 6-item scale that was originally developed to measure high school students’ out come expectation related to one’s career (e.g., My career planning will lead to a satisfying career for me) rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). McWhirter, Crothers, and Rasheed (2000) established concurrent validity of VOE with another 5-item measure of outcome expectations devel oped by Fouad and Smith (1996). The VOE has demonstrated satisfactory a coefficients ranging from .83 to .92 among samples of ethnically diverse youth (Ali, McWhirter, & Chronister, 2005; McWhirter et al., 2000). The a coefficient in the current study was .94.

Preliminary Analyses 
We tested potential age, sex, and racial differences in all of the variables. An independent sample t test indicated that there was a significant sex difference in perceived education and career barriers, t(151) ¼  2.03, p ¼ .044, with males reporting lower levels of perceived barriers (M ¼ 2.05, SD ¼ .52) than females (M ¼ 2.32, SD ¼ .61). There was no other significant sex difference. When exploring potential racial group differences, we combined Native American students (n ¼ 1) with others (n ¼ 3) given their small sample size. There was a statistically significant difference in perceived education and career barriers between groups as determined by one-way analysis of variance, F(4, 148) ¼ 2.53, p ¼ .04. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that Latinx students reported a significantly higher level of per ceived barriers (M ¼ 2.40, SD ¼ .59) than European American/White students (M ¼ 2.05, SD ¼ .56). There was no other statistically significant group difference. Finally, we tested the relationship between age and the variables in our study. There was no statistically significant correlation between age and any of the variables. 
The correlations, means, and standard deviations for the study variables are displayed in Table 1. A sense of coherence, support from family, friends, and a special person were significantly and positively correlated with the outcome variable of career outcome expectation, whereas perceived education and career-related barriers were significantly and negatively correlated with career outcome expectation. Social connectedness on campus was not significantly correlated with the outcome variable. 
Main Analyses 
The bootstrapping method was used to examine the indirect effects associated with our proposed med iator—sense of coherence, and moderators—social connectedness and multidimensional social sup port from family, friends, and a special person. Bootstrapping is a nonparametric resampling procedure that involves repeatedly sampling from the data set and estimating the indirect effect in each resampled data set without imposing the assumption of normality of the sampling distribution (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). Researchers have recommended the use of bootstrapping for testing indi rect effect in behavioral research over other approaches including the casual step strategy (Baron & Kenny, 1986) and the Sobel test (Sobel, 1986) for its relative power and control over the Type 1 error rate (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002). In the present study, we used Hayes’s (2013) PROCESS macro in SPSS v. 23—a regression-based approach, which provides bootstrapped estimates and 95% bias-corrected (BC) confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effects based on 5,000 resamples.

Figure 1. Unstandardized regression coefficients from the multiple mediation model testing the effect of per ceived education and career barriers on vocational outcome expectation through sense of coherence. C ¼ total effect of perceived education and career barriers on vocational outcome expectation. C’ ¼ direct effect of per ceived education and career barriers on psychological well-being. Estimates are based on N ¼ 153. 
Results from the mediation analysis demonstrated that the indirect effects of perceived education and career barriers on career outcome expectation through a sense of coherence were significant, and the BC CI did not contain a 0 (Bab ¼  .15; [BC] 95% CI [ .26,  .04]). For full results, see Figure 1. The total effect of perceived barriers on career outcome expectation was significant (B ¼  .35, p < .001), as well as both the a and b paths of the mediation model (Ba path ¼  .68, p < .001; Bb path ¼ .22, p ¼ .011). The mediator, a sense of coherence, can explain approximately 4% of the total negative influence of each additional level of perceived barriers to career outcome expectations. In other words, an increase in perceived education and career barriers was associated with a decreased sense of coherence, which in turn was associated with decreased career outcome expectations. To account for the shared associations between perceived barriers and the key variables in the model, age, gender, and race were included as covariates in the equations for both sense of coherence (mediator) and career outcome expectation (outcome variable). Since our sample comprises a large percentage of Latinx students (over 50%), we recoded racial groups into Latinx versus non-Latinx students. Even after controlling for the effect of these three covariates, the indirect effect of perceived barriers on career outcome expectations through a sense of coherence remained statistically different from zero (Bab ¼  .16; [BC] 95% CI [ .29,  .06]). The direct effect was not statistically significant (B ¼  .16, p ¼ .15). We retained and illustrated the more parsimonious model without the covariates in Figure 1. In sum, the study hypothesis is supported: A sense of coherence was a significant mediator in the relationship between perceived education and career barriers and career outcome expectations. 
Moderation analyses were conducted via Hayes’s (2013) PROCESS macro in SPSS v. 23 to exam ine the indirect effect of perceived education and career barriers on career outcome expectation through four moderators—social connectedness on campus, social support from family, friends, and a special person. Put in another way, we examined how the independent variable—perceived education and career barriers—would interact with the four moderators in their influence on career outcome expectation using a regression-based model. The interaction was probed by testing the conditional effects of perceived education and career barriers at three levels of social connectedness on campus—one stan dard deviation below the mean (low), at the mean (average), and one standard deviation above the mean (high). Results from moderation analyses indicated that social connectedness on campus significantly moderated the relationship between perceived education and career barriers and career outcome expec tations (B ¼ .18, p < .05; see Table 2 for full results). As shown in Table 3, perceived education and career barriers were significantly related to career outcome expectations when social connectedness

We also tested a moderation model with age, gender, and race as covariates. The interactions between perceived education and career barriers and social connectedness on campus remained statistically significant (B ¼ .18, p < .05). Similar to the prior model without the covariates, the associations between students’ perceived barriers and career outcome expectations were statistically significant only when their reported level of social con nectedness on campus was low or average (p < .001) but not when the reported level was high (p ¼ .29). Therefore, we retained the more parsimonious moderation model without the covariates. Finally, moderation analyses indicated that the interactions between perceived education and career barriers and social support from family (B ¼  .08, p ¼ .19), friends (B ¼  .02, p ¼ .81), and special/significant other (B ¼  .05, p ¼ .54) were not statistically significant. 
Discussion 
The current study identified factors that contributed to the career outcome expectations of FGCS. Con sistent with previous research findings, our results suggest that the higher level of barriers FGCS per ceive, the more likely they would have negative career outcome expecations. The current findings also indicate that with a higher sense of coherence and support from family, friends, and a special person, FGCS are more likely to have positive career outcome expectations. However, we did not find a direct relationship between campus connectedness and career outcome expectations. 
Our mediation and moderation analyses provide a fuller picture of how the variables interact and predict career outcome expectations. Our findings suggest that the association between perceived bar riers and career outcome expectations was mediated by a sense of coherence. Sense of coherence may provide a potential explanation for how perceived barriers affect FGCS’ attitudes toward their future career. Specifically, FGCS’ perceived barriers may influence how comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful they interpret their academic and career development (Antonovsky, 1987), which in turn shape their career outcome expectations. As described earlier, a sense of coherence is a frame of mind for how individuals experience their environment, both internally and externally, as predictable and consistent. As suggested by Davidson, Feldman, and Margalit (2012), targeting ways to improve 
Ma and Shea 99
FGCS’ sense of coherence and ability to manage difficulties with emotional strength and promote their willingness to utilize resources on campus could lead to positive academic and career outcomes. In terms of moderation analysis, our results indicate that due to the moderation effect, the relation ship between perceived barriers and career outcome expectations is stronger when the degree of cam pus connectedness is low. In other words, FGCS with a below average or average level of campus connectedness are more likely to have a negative attitude toward their future career when they encoun ter educational or career barriers. This relationship between perceived barriers and career outcome expectations, however, was not significant for FGCSs who experienced a high level of campus con nectedness. When FGCS’ lack a sense of belonging and connectedness to their campus community, they are more likely to endorse negative career expectations when they encounter barriers. In many ways, FGCS’ experiences parallel those of marginalized student groups on campus. It has been reported that immigrant and ethnic minority FGCS, in particular, often feel uncomfortable approaching instructional agents such as faculty members or academic advisors and instead would pre fer to rely on peer network for assistance and advisement (Stebleton et al., 2014; Torres, Reiser, LePeau, & Ruder, 2006). As a result, when FGCS lack an adequate social connection on campus to seek advice from, they perceive their college experience as having more difficulty, which leads to neg ative outcome expectations of their future. 
Although ethnicity and gender were not the main variables of interest, the results of our study revealed that Latinx FGCS tended to report higher levels of perceived barriers when compared with European/White American and other ethnic minority FGCS. Moreover, female FGCS tended to expe rience higher levels of perceived barriers than their male counterparts did. Latinx college students have traditionally been underrepresented in higher education but disproportionally overrepresented among FGCS (Trevino & DeFreitas, 2014). They are at a higher risk of dropping out due to various stressors such as financial pressure and difficulty balancing work, school, and family demands (Tseng, 2004). Future research should further explore ways, including campus-based prevention and intervention pro grams, to reduce barriers and promote academic engagement for this group (Trevino & DeFreitas, 2014). For instance, a recent exploratory study conducted by Shea, Shi, Torres, Oceguera, and Ventura (2016) found that a short-term, peer-led, school-based intervention group for young Latina mothers helped reduce their level of perceived stress, depression, and increase their perceived social support quality. 
Limitations 
The study has several limitations that merit consideration. First, the participants in this study are pre dominantly undergraduate female FGCS recruited from the psychology subject pool and psychology courses. While Psychology is considered a science discipline, our findings, particularly when it comes to career outcome expectations, may not be representative of students pursuing technology, engineer ing, and math careers (Garriott, Flores, & Martens, 2013) or to non-STEM (Science, technology, engi neering, and math) students. In addition, these participants are students attending two public universities with a racially ethnically diverse student body, and the majority of students are commu ters. Therefore, a generalization of our findings to students of color, FGCS who are attending a pre dominantly white institution, or FGCS who are living on campus with more opportunities to establish campus connections may not be appropriate. Another limitation to highlight is that recent lit erature pointed out that the mediation process requires some time for the effect to unfold, and a long itudinal design would be a more appropriate approach for this study than traditional cross-sectional method (Preacher, 2015). 
The limitations of the current study, however, can serve as a guide for future research. Future stud ies, especially longitudinal studies over time, should continue to investigate specific factors that might enhance FGCS’ educational and career planning experience and further explore the intersectionality of

race/ethnicity, gender, social class, acculturation experience, FGCS status, and their collective impact on their sense of belonging and adjustment in the college context (e.g., Yeager et al., 2016).

Our findings provided additional evidence to support the development of effective programs or inter ventions on campus that can enhance the meaning of FGCS’ educational experience, cultivate a sense of belonging, and connectedness to other students, faculty, mentors, or alike. For FGCS who are com muters and juggling multiple responsibilities at work, school, and home, connecting with and seeking support from their faculty, peers, or family can be challenging. More than ever, FGCS can benefit from a learning community that is built into their academic curriculum. The goal is for students to be able to engage in positive social interaction with those who can understand and relate to their struggles while they are attending classes or small-group tutoring activities (Davis, 2010; Lowery-Hart & Pacheco, 2011). The built-in feature alleviates the burden on FGCS to attend extra events and minimizes their barrier to seeking help. A peer mentor system where new students are paired up with seniors who are FGCS and close to completion of their degree can also promote positive attitudes toward their future educational and career planning (Davis, 2010). 
In addition, programs should provide an opportunity for FGCS to examine the meaning of their col lege education and the connection to their future career. Campus workshops, instructional curricula, and intervention programs can incorporate themes that highlight the barriers commonly faced by FGCS, such as financial stress and lack of support from their family, so that they feel psychologically prepared for the need to tackle specific obstacles. Engaging students in an open dialogue about how their background as an FGCS, along with other factors relating to race, ethnicity, and social class, can be beneficial in helping students connect and reflect on their own experience (Gibbons & Woodside, 2014). Specifically, research has supported that intervention programs that include first-year FGCS listening to senior students’ stories on how their FG status can be a challenge and a source of strengths, and learn concrete strategies on how to be successful, has had a positive influence 2 years later. FGCS receiving the intervention feel more at ease with the campus community and achieve a higher level of academic success. They also demonstrated improved coping skills in stressful situations (Stephens, Brannon, Markus, & Nelson, 2015; Stephens, Hamedani, & Destin, 2014). Intervention programs that emphasize the development and utilization of positive character strengths such as hope and optimism can also further promote FGCS’ sense of coherence (Davidson et al., 2012). 
The present study examines the factors that contribute to the links between FGCS’ perceived bar riers and career outcome expectations. The results suggest that the higher the level of sense of coher ence and support from family, friends, and a special person FGCS endorse, the more favorable their career outcome expectations would be. Furthermore, a sense of coherence mediates the role of per ceived barriers on FGCS’ attitudes toward their future career, such that a higher level of perceived edu cation and career barriers would be associated with a decreased sense of coherence, which in turn would lead to less favorable career outcome expectations. Finally, for FGCS who experience low or average level of campus connectedness, a higher level of perceived education and career barriers is associated with less favorable career outcome expectations. The findings contribute to the literature on FGCS’ career development and has implications to programming in higher education settings that would better support this population.
